# Neon-Portfolio
This is a basic portfolio, based on the layout given in the homework files.
Many boxes inside boxes and then reshaped

backround , footer and colors changed to gradients, or near the same colors of preferance.

The about me page is 4 rows of text with a photo at the begining showing how it would look if i had something to write about myself.

The portfolio page is 2 colums set to the left side by making them each 4 colums and having the right side empty to mimic the example. there is a non responive hover effect to show example text block over the images.

contact page is a bootstap contact form, to include name, email, and a message with some comical placeholders.
the submit currently doesnt function.
